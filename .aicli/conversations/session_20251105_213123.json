Information about what specific task or functionality you're testing\n2. Details about what tool calls you've observed or expected\n3. Context about how these tool calls should ideally be optimized\n\nCould you please provide more specific information about:\n- What task or functionality you're evaluating\n- What tool calls you've observed or want me to analyze\n- What optimization criteria you'd like me to consider\n\nThis will help me give you a meaningful evaluation of the tool usage patterns and potential optimizations.\n<tool_call>\n{\n    \"tool\": \"get_modified_files\",\n    \"arguments\": {}\n}\n</tool_call>",
